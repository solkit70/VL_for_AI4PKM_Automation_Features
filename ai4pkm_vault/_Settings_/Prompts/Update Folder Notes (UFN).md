## Main Process
```
1. FOLDER NOTE CREATION
   - Create folder note if non-existent
   - Use [[Folder Note Template]] as base
   - Establish proper structure and sections

2. RECENT CHANGES UPDATE

   - Add/update Recent Changes section
   - Highlight new or modified content

## Caveats
### Template Consistency
⚠️ **CRITICAL**: Base all new folder notes on [[Folder Note Template]]

### Content Standards

- Focus on folder purpose and organization
- Keep overview concise but comprehensive

### Update Requirements
- Update existing folder notes rather than recreating
- Maintain existing structure when possible
- Highlight recent changes and additions
