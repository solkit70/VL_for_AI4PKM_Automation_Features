Improve existing topic notes through structure validation, source discovery, and summary optimization.

## Input
- Scope: /Topics/ (default) or specified topic directory
- Existing topic notes within scope
- [[Topic Template]] for structure reference
- Available sources for term-based and semantic search

## Output
- Improved topic notes with balanced summaries
- Validated and working source links
- Enhanced structure following template
- Added relevant sources through search

## Main Process
```
1. STRUCTURE VALIDATION
   - Check structure against [[Topic Template]]
   - Ensure proper formatting and sections
   - Balance length and format of summary

2. SOURCE DISCOVERY
   - Find relevant sources using term-based search
   - Conduct semantic search for related content
   - Add newly discovered relevant sources

3. LINK VALIDATION & CLEANUP
   - Ensure all source links work properly
   - Remove summaries for broken links
   - Maintain one line per source format
```

## Caveats
### Summary Standards
⚠️ **CRITICAL**: Maintain one line per source for consistency

### Link Validation
- All source links must be working
- Remove summary if link is broken
- Validate links before finalizing updates

### Search Strategy
- Use both term-based and semantic search
- Focus on relevant and high-quality sources
- Balance comprehensiveness with quality
