   - Keep original language (English/한글)
   - Fill note sections appropriately

2. COMPREHENSIVE SOURCE INTEGRATION
   - Count available sources first
   - Integrate Apple Notes with summaries
   - Extract insights from Life Logs (AI/Lifelog)
   - Review ALL available clippings for date
   - Include book-related content
   - Create "Additional Materials" if >10 clippings
   - Generate source coverage report

3. QUOTE MINING & TOPIC LINKING
   - Extract 3-5 memorable quotes preserving voice
   - Search existing Topics directory before linking
   - Validate all topic links point to existing files
   - Add "Topics to Create" list if needed

4. JOURNAL ENHANCEMENT

   - Add roundup link to links property
   - Ensure bidirectional linking is complete
```

## Caveats
### Source Coverage Requirements
⚠️ **CRITICAL**: Target 80%+ coverage of available sources

### Quote Mining Standards
- Format: > "Quote text" - Context/Speaker if applicable
- Prioritize voice preservation over summary
- Include quotes from multiple sources
- Place strategically to support key insights

### Topic Linking Validation
- **CRITICAL**: Search existing Topics directory BEFORE creating links
- Format: "[[Category/Page Title]]" (e.g., "[[Technology/AI Tools]]")
- All topic links must point to existing files
- Use established topics: PKM.md, AI Tools.md, Golf.md, Life Philosophy.md

### Journal Enhancement Rules
- Be brief but comprehensive
- Don't touch existing contents
- Each content should have link(s) to source note
- Ensure bidirectional linking is complete
